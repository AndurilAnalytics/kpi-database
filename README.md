At the core of any performance measurement and management system are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). They provide the important data that is monitored and reported within an organization, by using scorecards or dashboards.

In practice, the terminology used to express them is diverse. The most common expressions are: performance measures, performance indicators, metrics, key performance indicators or key result areas. Both academic and practitioner literature use these terms interchangeably, oftentimes even within the same organization. This can cause confusion among stakeholders, and it can also affect the way these tools are used in practice. Establishing a common terminology at organizational level brings everyone on the same page and facilitates a consistent approach to KPIs.

#### Metric
It has its roots in the word “metron,” used in ancient Greece to reflect measurement. Metrics refer to something we can measure, a value, or a quantity. Examples of metrics are: # Air temperature, # Air quality, # Water depth, # Height, # Weight or # Employees. When metrics reflect the achievement of a desired state, they become Key Performance Indicators. Oftentimes, metrics represent the subordinated measures used for calculating a KPI.

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
A measurable expression for the achievement of a desired level of results, in an area relevant to the evaluated entity’s activity. KPIs make objectives quantifiable, providing visibility into the performance of individuals, teams, departments and organizations and enabling decision makers to take action in achieving the desired outcomes. Typically, KPIs are monitored and communicated through dashboards, scorecards and other forms of performance reports.

#### Key Risk Indicator (KRI)
A metric that provides an early warning regarding an increased risk exposure in a certain area of operations. For example, a high level of % Clients experiencing financial difficulties can indicate the risk of not being able to collect all debts and will negatively impact $ Write-off accounts. By monitoring KRIs, managers are able to take a proactive approach in risk management by preventing incidents or diminishing their impact, when they occur.

#### Analytics
Consists in a data analysis of KPI results, meant to determine trends and data patterns in order to provide valuable information for better decision making. Analytics offer a better understanding of how the business works, and the interdependencies between KPIs. Predictive analytics can provide valuable insights in regards to our customers’ purchasing habits, the best time to launch a product, or how internal processes can be optimized. In conclusion, everything we measure is a metric. If it reflects performance it becomes a KPI. If it reflects risk, it becomes a KRI. With all of these tools – metrics, KPIs and KRIs – we can do analytics to explore trends.

### KPI Schema

The schema to collecting KPI data is broken into 2 layers:
- Data
  - Definition: Critical/Minimum data required to define a KPI
  - Examples: Name, Description, Variables
- Metadata
  - Description: Wide body of data that describes, provides context, and groups the KPI into relevant categories
  - Examples: Industry, Function, Factor/Key Driver, Known Users, Data Providers
